# Machine Learning and Friends Lunch

How to update this website: there are three things you need to update on a regular basis.

## MLFL Metadata

Once a semester, update the following lines in `_config.yml`

```
# MLFL settings
current_semester_name: "Spring 2020"
current_sem_start: 2020-01-20
current_sem_end: 2020-04-29
```

This affects what the semester is called, and which talks appear in "This semester" vs "Archive".

## Speaker data

Speaker data is recorded in a Google sheets spreadsheet, which you should have access to if you are a MLFL organizer. 
Add new rows for each speaker in the spreadsheet. The code cannot handle new lines in the abstract, make sure you remove new lines before pasting it into the spreadsheet. 
Any time there are new updates to the Website Data spreadsheet, 
download the sheet as a TSV (File > Download > Tab-separated values (.tsv)). Then, run

`python process_info.py /path/to/new/tsv/file.tsv`

and then commit and push. This script is compatible with Python 3.7.6.

## Speaker headshots

Speaker headshots are stored in `assets/headshots/`. 
They are stored as square images named `FirstnameMiddleNameLastname_yyyy-mm-dd.jpg`. 
You may have to update the code if there are duplicate names. `process_info` will print a warning if this happens.
