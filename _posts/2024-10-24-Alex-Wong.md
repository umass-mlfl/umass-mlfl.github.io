## Abstract

Training deep neural networks requires tens of thousands to millions of examples, so curating multimodal vision datasets amounts to numerous man-hours; tasks like depth estimation require an even more massive effort. I will introduce an alternative form of supervision that leverages multi-sensor validation as an unsupervised (or self-supervised) training objective for depth estimation. To address its ill-posedness, I will show how one can leverage multimodal inputs in the choice of regularizers, which can play a role in model complexity, speed, generalization, as well as adaptation to test-time (possibly adverse) environments. Additionally, I will discuss the current limitations of data augmentation procedures used during unsupervised training, which involves reconstructing the inputs as the supervision signal, and detail a method that allows one to scale up and introduce previously inviable augmentations to boost performance. Finally, I will show how one can scalably expand the number of modalities supported by multimodal models and demonstrate their use in a number of downstream semantic tasks.
