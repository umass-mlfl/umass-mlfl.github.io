## Bio



## Abstract

Having a humanoid robot operating like a human has been a long-standing goal in robotics. The humanoid robot provides a generalized purpose platform to conduct diverse tasks we do in our daily lives. In this talk, we study learning-based approaches for both the mobility and manipulation skills of the humanoid robot, with the goal of generalization to diverse tasks, objects, and scenes. I will discuss how to perform whole-body control in humanoids with rich, diverse, and expressive motions. I will also share some lessons we learned from developing teleoperation systems to operate humanoid robots and collect training data. With the collected data, we aim to build the robot foundation model using a novel RNN architecture with Test-Time Training (TTT).
