## Abstract

apturing our belief about an unknown given observations. Central in this paradigm are probabilistic models and approximate inference methods. The former models oneâ€™s prior belief and encodes the data, while the latter produces posterior distributions based on the former. In the era of large-scale neural networks and foundation models, leveraging them in probabilistic modeling or improving them using probabilistic inference is challenging due to their sheer size. In this talk, I will discuss recent works in (i) developing efficient probabilistic models with and for large foundation models, (ii) leveraging the resulting powerful, calibrated beliefs to improve decision-making and planning, and (iii) applying the resulting probabilistic decision-making/planning systems for improving scientific discovery, and improving the neural networks themselves.
